# NppPluginCutNCopyLine
Notepad++ plugin where Cut and Copy operate on the whole line when no selection is made (mimics  how Visual Studio works).

Activate the plugin via the menu items or use `ctrl+c` or `ctrl+x`

# Installation
This plugin is too new to have been added to the notepad++ pluginmanager - that takes a couple of months to get in place. So manual installation only.

  * Download a binary release and stick the `CutNCopyLine.dll` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins`

Alternatively, download the source and build it - the build will copy the dll to the notepad folder.


# Misc
Built using the Notepad++ plugin pack https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net
